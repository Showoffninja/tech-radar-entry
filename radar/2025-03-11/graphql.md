## Description
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries against your data. Unlike REST, it allows clients to request only the specific data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of information. It provides a flexible and efficient way to interact with APIs by enabling clients to define the structure of the response, making data fetching more precise and scalable.

## Context
GraphQL is not specific to any particular team, product, or scenario—it is a flexible API query language that can be used across various industries and applications. It is particularly beneficial for frontend and backend teams working on web and mobile applications.
Problems GraphQL Addresses:

    Over-fetching & Under-fetching – Unlike REST, where endpoints return fixed data structures, GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, reducing bandwidth usage and improving performance.
    Multiple API Calls – Instead of making multiple requests to different REST endpoints, GraphQL enables fetching all related data in a single request, reducing latency.
    Evolving APIs Without Versioning – GraphQL schemas allow adding new fields without breaking existing queries, eliminating the need for versioned APIs.
    Complex Data Relationships – It simplifies fetching nested or relational data (e.g., fetching a user’s posts and comments in one request), making it ideal for applications with complex data dependencies.
    Strongly Typed API – The GraphQL schema defines a strict type system, improving API predictability, documentation, and developer experience.

It is widely used by companies like Facebook, GitHub, Shopify, and Airbnb to improve API efficiency and flexibility.
